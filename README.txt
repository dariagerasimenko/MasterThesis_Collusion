# Master Thesis Project: **Collusion Detection Using Auto-Encoders and Clustering Algorithms**

This is my Master Thesis project on the topic **"Collusion detection using auto-encoders and clustering algorithms"**.

## Project Structure

This project contains the following files:

### 1. `Collusion_Detection.py`
   - This is the main Python script to analyze the collusive dataset and generate graphs and tables.
   - It includes both **classification** and **clustering models** for detecting patterns of collusion.

### 2. `utils.py`
   - This file contains all the helper functions used in the main code (`Collusion_Detection.py`), organized for modularity and ease of access.

### 3. `requirements.txt`
   - This file lists all the necessary Python packages required to run the scripts. Install the dependencies with:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it for similar datasets or applications!
